# IQLBPS Bootcamp Final Project: The Board Project

In general, this open-ended project will involve working on an app that has a
concept of "boards" and "board items". It could be a to-do list, or it could be
something else; you may decide the purpose/function of this application. We are
excited to see what you think of. Some examples of things in similar categories
are:

- To-do list (you are not allowed to do this one)
- Brainstorm board
- [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)
- Notetaking apps

## Learning objectives

- Connecting to a backend with Firebase
- Modeling your data
- Using React

## Code Requirements

- Only use function components
- You will want to look into how **hooks** are used

## Data Requirements

In the requirements below, the terms are quite general, since they depend on
exactly what you planned out for your app.

- A user should be able to create a **board/list**. Conceptually, a board/list
  would contain many items that a user can add.
- For each board, a user should be able to add **board items/tasks**.
- Board items should have:
  - A due date
  - A title
  - A boolean flag for completd or not completed
  - An assignee (someone it is assigned to). It can be any random string that
    the user wants.
  - Anything else that you decide

## Functional requirements

- **Theme and framework**: Use one of
  [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [Ant
  Design](https://ant.design/), Material Bootstrap, [Material UI (not recommended)](https://material-ui.com/).
  Install the package using `npm` or `yarn`.
- **Routing**: Use [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) to
  navigate to different pages.
- **Sorting within a given board.** A user should be able to sort by title and
  due date, both ascending and descending.
- **Completed tasks.** Completed tasks should not be shown on the main boards.
  When a task is marked completed, you may decide how it will be shown, but it
  should be separated. For example, you could have a special board for completed
  tasks, or you could make a completely separate page that loads all the
  completed tasks.
- **Navbar**: There should be a navbar that has at least: "home page" (board
  overview), "about", and (optionally, see previous point) "completed."
- **Editing an existing task**: A user should be able to edit and save any
  properties of a task, such as title and due dates.
- **Deletion of board and board item**: A user should be able to delete any
  board or board item.
- **Toggle display type**: There should be a button that allows users to toggle
  between "list" and "board" views of all the boards. Hint: keep a state
  variable on the container that contains two possible values. Here is an
  example of what we mean by [board](./board-example.png) and
  [list](./list-example.png). List-view only has to be read-only

## Checkpoints

### Week 1

Two minute demo of:

- Creation and reading of a board in Firebase
- Creation and reading of a board item in Firebase
- Working navbar with React Routing
- Editing and Existing Board item in Firebase

The user should be able to fill out forms to create a board and board item and
have it show up in the UI, no matter how it looks. No styling is required (I
encourage you to worry about styling later).

### Week 2

Completion of rest of the feature

# Appendix

Below, you'll find additional resources not directly related to the requirements
of the project.

## Planning

I highly recommend that you write out your "schema" before starting. A schema
means a list of keys (fields) that are present on each type of object. What
keys can a board have? What keys can a board item have? Any other objects
that you need to keep track of?

## Examples

There are tons of examples of such apps, even just a click away from here. You
may want to look into any of the following products or terms for inspiration.

- GitHub Boards
- Kanban boards
- Wunderlist
- Trello
- Asana

I'm intentionally not including any pictures as examples, I want you to use your
imagination and look around for inspiration.

## Reminders

- Please read this documentation
- Please read the React documentation for function components
- Please read the Firebase documentation
- Look at lots of example code when writing your app
- Work together with your partners, split the work and use gitub issues and pull requests

## Extra credit

- Add users and registration using Firebase. See [Firebase
  Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth). A user should be able to login,
  logout, access their own board, etc.
- Allow users to upload at least one image associated with an item.
- Allow users to rearrange the board via drag and drop (and persist the order in
  the backend!). Take a look at the
  [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd) library.
  
  ## Teamwork guide

In this project we will be practicing the work enviornment similar to the one we will have during our capstones so please read the following section carefully and feel free to do your research or ask us any questions incase you need help

### Repo managment

- One of the teammates will have to fork this repo and then add other teammates as collaborators to the project
- Now that everyone is added as collaborators, make sure to clone the repo to your local machine because this is where we will do all our work
- To collaborate effectively together you will follow an approach similar to [SCRUM](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum)

### Project planning

_please read this section carefully and follow these steps during the project_

- The first phase of the project we would like you to have a meeting with your teammates and start to map out the tasks you will need to do to finish the project, ex: Work on the single actor page, Style the current home page, Work on the navbar, etc.

- Some of the tasks might be big so make sure to split these into smaller tasks that you can finish in a day or two, ex: Fetch data for the actor page, Style the actor page, Style the navbar, etc.

- On your repository create an issue for each task you will be working on with a description of what you will be doing and assign it to the person who will work on this issue (You will see an issues tab on the repo)

- We recommend assigning issues that you think you can finish in a week, this way you can keep track of your progress and make sure you are not overloading yourself with too many tasks

- [Daily standup meetings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er9gntPjTJU) is a great way to keep track of your progress and make sure you are on the same page with your teammates, we recommend having a meeting every morning to discuss what you did yesterday, what you will be doing today and if you have any blockers

- You will repeat this process weekly until you finish the project

### Git workflow

- Now that you have your issues created, you can start working on them, make sure to create a new branch for each issue you are working on and name it something like `actor-page` or `navbar` and then push your code to that branch

- After you push your branch to the repo, you can create a pull request and assign it to your teammate who will review your code and merge it to the main branch, make sure to link the issue to the pull request so it will be closed automatically once the pull request is merged

- After two of your teammates have reviewed your code and approved it, you can merge it to the main branch, please watch this video on how to [review code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW0RPaJqm4g)

- These are things to look for while you are reviewing code:

  - Is the code clean and easy to read?
  - Are there any bugs?
  - Is the code efficient?
  - Is the code following the best practices?
